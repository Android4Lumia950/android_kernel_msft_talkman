URGENT: freezes at boot, please fix v_U64_t vos_get_bootbased_boottime_ns(void)
{
       return ktime_to_ns(ktime_get_boottime());
}
in vos_api.c in directory drivers/staging/qcacld-2.0/CORE/VOSS/src, lines 3002 to 3005
Original implementation was: 
return ktime_get_boot_ns();

error we are getting:
drivers/staging/qcacld-2.0/CORE/VOSS/src/vos_api.c:3004:15: error: implicit declaration of function ‘ktime_get_boot_ns’; did you mean ‘ktime_get_boottime’? [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
        return ktime_get_boot_ns();

THIS IS A backport from pixel xl king kernel which also uses qca6174 for wifi and bluetooth, attempt to fix heating on Lumia950/XL Wi-Fi. (Probably needs a declaration), for King kernel's source refer to: https://github.com/King-Kernel/KingKernel-rebased
